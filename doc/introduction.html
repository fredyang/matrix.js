	<h1>Introducing Matrix.js</h1>

	<h2>What is Matrix.js</h2>

	<p>Marix.js is an extensible JavaScript library that can load client side modules on demand from
		server. It helps you to build Single Page Application with faster loading speed, less memory
		consumption, and better module reusability. </p>

	<h2>What is the dependency of Matrix.js</h2>

	<p>jQuery 1.5+. It can dynamically load jQuery from CDN, if jQuery is not loaded.</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

	<p>Today, we are trying to build large scale Single Page Application with experience of
		native application. This kind of application usually depends lots of modules. These modules
		can be are system modules like jQuery, or MV-ish library/Framework, or they can be
		application modules such customs widget, template, css module, localization resource, lookup
		data. As the application grows, the number of moduels increase. These becomes quite a
		challenge us. Here is a couple of problems that I have want to solve.
	</p>

<ol class="simpleList">
	<li>
		Slow application start-up time.
		<p>We tend to load all the modules that an application need in the entire life time of the application.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Application can load module on demand it can not release module when it does not need it anymore.
	</li>
	<li>
		Application can load JavaScript files on demand only.
	</li>

</ol>


<!--There are some solutions like <a href="http://requirejs.org">requirejs</a>. I
		really want to love it, but after struggling for some time, I conclude that it does not fit
		into my projects. So I write this library for my personal use. If you are statisfied with
		requirejs, you should stick with it. Otherwise reads on.-->
	<h2>What is a module?</h2>

	<p>In the sense of matrix.js, it is a software construct that can be deployed to the browser
		such as a JavaScript file, CSS style sheet, image, localization resource, a coffee script
		file, even a string, a function, JSON object, or a CSS rule. A module is not necessarily
		mapped to downloadable unit such as a file, although in a lot of case it is.</p>

	<h2>What is the problem that Matrix.js tries to solve</h2>

	<p>Today we are</p>
	<!--
 1.	Too many modules are loaded in to browser due to messy dependencies.
 2.	Application startup time is slow as all modules are loaded in during page load.
 3.	Application gets slower over time, because modules are not unloaded when they are not used and their runtime resource cannot be reclaimed.
 4.	Unconventional modules such as a template, a JavaScript object, loaded on demand.
